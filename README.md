# Sorting_Visualizer
The visualizer typically displays a set of elements, represented by bars or other graphical objects, in a random or user-defined order. The user can select a specific sorting algorithm, such as bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quicksort, or heap sort, and start the visualization.

As the sorting algorithm progresses, the visualizer highlights the elements being compared or swapped, making it easy to follow the sorting process. The elements may change positions, merge together, or shift around the display to reflect the changes occurring during the sorting algorithm's execution.

Additionally, the visualizer often provides controls for adjusting the speed of the visualization, allowing users to observe the sorting process at different speeds or pause it at any point for closer examination. Some visualizers may also display additional information, such as the current state of the data structure or the number of comparisons and swaps performed.

By visually representing the sorting algorithms, these visualizers offer an interactive and educational tool for understanding the mechanics and efficiency of different sorting techniques. Users can observe how algorithms compare elements, rearrange them, and eventually achieve a sorted order, enhancing their understanding of sorting concepts and algorithms.
